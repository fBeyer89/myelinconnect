# convert levelset 2 mesh with cbstools layout (use avg suface, i.e. mid cortex)

# open vtk in paraview and save as ply in ascii format (possibly write script for this)

# open ply in meshlab and simplify surface:

	# make new layer (duplicate)
	# filters - remeshing, decimation, simplification - quadric edge collapse decimation

# commandline
v=b
meshlabserver -i rh_avg_orig.ply -o rh_avg_simple_$v.ply -s simple_$v.mlx -d simple_$v.filter -l simple_$v.log


version a
# percent reduction 0.037 (1/27)
# quality threshold .5
# preserve mesh boundaries
# preserve topology
# preserve normals
# optimal position
# post-simplification clean

version b
like a but percent reduction 0.111 (1/9)

version c
like b plus planar simplification

version d
like b but quality threshold 1

version e
like b but do not preseve topology
