# convert levelset 2 mesh with cbstools layout (use avg suface, i.e. mid cortex)

# open vtk in paraview and save as ply in ascii format (possibly write script for this)

# open ply in meshlab and simplify surface:

# make new layer (duplicate)
# filters - remeshing, decimation, simplification - quadric edge collapse decimation

	# percent reduction 0.111 (1/9)
	# quality threshold 1
	# preserve mesh boundaries
	# preserve topology
	# preserve normals
	# optimal position
	# post-simplification clean

# commandline
